## 💡 Tips

1. **Ranks are case-insensitive:** "general", "General", or "GENERAL" all work
2. **Plural recognized:** "generals" or "General" both work
3. **Natural language:** The AI tries to understand natural phrasing
4. **Be specific:** Include names and ranks clearly

---

## ⚠️ Permission Required

Remember, only users with these roles can use `/tf` commands:
- **Commander**
- **Marshal**
- **General**

---

## 🧪 Examples to Try

```
/tf show all members
/tf list all commanders
/tf what rank is João?
/tf change Sarah to Marshal
/tf add Mike as Aspirant
/tf log raid for John
/tf remove Bob
```

All of these should work perfectly now! 🎉
